 * Atomically updates the value of the [MutableStateFlow] only if the given [predicate] is satisfied.
 *
 * The [predicate] function is called with the current value of the [MutableStateFlow]. If it returns `true`,
 * the [transform] function is applied to the current value, and the result is set as the new value of the flow.
 * If the [predicate] returns `false`, the value of the flow remains unchanged.
 *
 * This operation is atomic, meaning that the [predicate] check and the update (if performed) happen
 * as a single, uninterrupted operation, ensuring that the current value is not changed by
 * other threads between the check and the update.
 *
 * @param predicate A function that determines whether the update should occur based on the current value.
 * @param transform A function that transforms the current value into the new value if the predicate is true.
